<p class="drop-cap">This, little Dear-My-Love,
is the story of a
Child whom I am sure
you would have loved.
For people did love her
very much, she was so
quaint and dear.</p>

<p>She was a remarkably
bright Child and the
beauty of her being
bright was that she did
not know it. She did bright things and said
bright things and it never entered her mind to
marvel at her own cleverness. However, I
doubt if she would have thought of what I am
going to tell you, had it not been for the
Storyist.</p>

<p>It was somewhat absurd, the whole thing;
yet it was an experience one would not soon
forget.</p>

<p>It began, little Dear-My-Love, on a certain
morning when the Child stood looking out of
the window of her own pretty room. She was
watching two little birds which sat huddled
close together on the branch of a big fir
tree; but she really wasn’t thinking about the
birds. She had heard Lady-Mother say at
breakfast that it lacked but two weeks of
Christmas, and she had not yet selected her
Gift for Lady-Mother. She was so extremely
particular about what it should be that it was
difficult to decide upon anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>Presently the Child had an idea; and the
more she thought of it, the more splendid it
seemed as a surprise for Lady-Mother. You
see, little Dear-My-Love, she wasn’t old
enough to be very wise and so sometimes she
did rather queer things.</p>

<p>A few moments later she knocked at the
door of the Storyist.</p>

<p>She found her writing, as usual, but the
Storyist was patient about interruptions and
this time she set the Child lovingly upon her
knee and asked what she could do for her.</p>

<p>“I’d like some story-paper,” said the
Child.</p>

<p>“You may have all you wish,” proffered the
Storyist, handing her a pad of scratch-paper.</p>

<p>The Child fingered it critically. “Will it
do?” she asked.</p>

<p>The Storyist smiled. “I think it will—for
you,” she said.</p>

<p>“But you see I want it very nice,” explained
the Child, “because it’s for a Christmas
story I’m going to write. That is, the
story isn’t <em>about</em> Christmas, but it’s for a
Christmas present.”</p>

<p>The Storyist appeared interested. “So?”
she said. “Who is it for? But I think I can
guess,” she added quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, if you know please don’t tell,” cautioned
the Child. Then she asked, “May I
see what you’re writing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly,” assented the Storyist, and
showed her a typewritten sheet.</p>

<p>The Child read:</p>

<p>“‘Her voice was that smooth and slippery-like
that you found yourself swallowing what
she said without realizing till afterward that
the words stuck in your throat.’”</p>

<p>She read it a second time, but was sure she
didn’t quite understand.</p>

<p>“Is it hard?” she inquired.</p>

<p>The Storyist looked thoughtful. “Not
very,” she replied. “You just have to know
what you want to say and then say it the best
you can.”</p>

<p>It sounded reasonable and the Child grew
encouraged.</p>

<p>“She’d be surprised to see it in a paper,
wouldn’t she?” she laughed.</p>

<p>The Storyist agreed that she would.</p>

<p>When she went out she held tightly several
sheets of typewriter paper and a newly-sharpened
soft pencil. She was eager to begin. She
set herself down at the tiny desk Lady-Mother
had given her and everything was still for a
long time.</p>

<p>Of course she was very little to think of
trying to write a story, but O, little Dear-My-Love,
she knew perfectly well <em>just</em> what she
wanted to say!</p>

<p>And so she worked very hard indeed and
wrote as fast as she could make her letters.</p>

</div>


<div><img class="drop-cap illowe8" src="images/i_dropcap_a.jpg" alt="A" title="A" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">And that night, little
Dear-My-Love, an odd
thing happened. It was
some time after Lady-Mother
had kissed her
and, turning out the
light, had gone softly
away, that the Child
heard a voice say, right
in her ear:</p>

<p>“It’s very queer.”</p>

<p>She started up in bed. “What’s queer?” she
said. But no one answered her. She sank
back again upon the pillow and wondered if
she had been dreaming. If she had—</p>

<p>“What did you say was queer?”</p>

<p>It was some one else speaking this time, and
the Child raised herself on her elbow and
listened intently.</p>

<p>Then the first voice said, “Why, about the
train, you know. She might have known it
would be troublesome. Of course, if it weren’t
so long I could manage it better, but as it
is—” and the voice trailed off into a sigh.</p>

<p>The Child waited to hear no more. “What
makes you ‘sigh like a furnace’?” she said. She
had heard the Storyist quote Shakespeare with
good effect.</p>

<p>The voice answered her; its tones were very
sweet. “O, I didn’t know you were awake!”
it said. “Is this where you always sleep?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Child. “Do you like it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>“It’s very pretty,” said the voice. “It
must be a relief to have a room small enough
for convenience. Why, even this foot-board—”</p>

<p>“O, is that where you are?” asked the
Child. “I’ve been looking all over but I
couldn’t see you. Why, you’re Lady Arabella!”
she cried, as she caught sight of a
small figure, elaborately dressed, balancing
itself on one end of the foot-board. “How did
you get here?”</p>

<p>“Well, I simply had to come,” said Lady
Arabella. “I had to get where it was warmer.
Did I hear you say something about a furnace?”</p>

<p>The Child looked at her in surprise. “Yes;
were you cold?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I should say,” replied Arabella. “Those
marble halls are just dreadfully cold; they’re
positively frigid. Sometimes we dance as
you told us to, and that warms us up. But
I was too tired to-night to dance.”</p>

<p>If Arabella could have seen the Child’s face
she would have noticed how sorry and disturbed
it looked. But it was too dark in the
room for her to see distinctly.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I never thought of that,” said
the Child, and her tone was penitent. “You
see, I thought you would like the marble
halls. But I never had any ’sperience with
them myself. Why don’t you put on extra
wraps when you feel so cold?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>“Extra wraps!” repeated Arabella. “I
haven’t any. The only kinds of clothes I
have are dinner gowns and ball gowns. They’re
not very warm, you know. I often tie handkerchiefs
around my throat when that gets
cold, but they are only ‘dreams of lace’ and
don’t do much good. Don’t you think you
could get me a wrap or two?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed, I can,” answered the Child.
“I’ll see about it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And a matinee for mornings,” Arabella
suggested. “Something that won’t soil, especially
as I have to spend all my mornings
in the conservatory.”</p>

<p>“What makes you stay there?” asked the
Child. “Why not go somewhere else?” She
was by this time sitting up in bed, her hands
clasped about one knee, intensely interested.</p>

<p>“I have to,” answered Arabella, with another
sigh. “I have to do what you tell me
to.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” declared the Child; “I’ll
change that to-morrow, too.” Then she suddenly
remembered her manners. “Won’t
you sit down?” she asked.</p>

<p>“How can I up here?” Arabella replied.
“My train is in the way. If you could help
me down I should like it.”</p>

<p>So the Child reached out her two hands
and, lowering Arabella to the bed, placed her
carefully upon the counterpane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to bring Sir Marmaduke,
too?” asked her visitor in dismay.</p>

<p>“Is he up there? I didn’t see him,” said
the Child.</p>

<p>“He and I were talking when you first
woke up,” answered Arabella. “Don’t you
remember? Certainly he is here. He has
to be always at my side, you know. At
least, that’s what you said.”</p>

<p>“So I did,” acknowledged the Child. Then
she began to laugh. “O, dear!” she gasped,
“I didn’t think how it would be, you see—his
<em>always</em> being with you! O, I didn’t really
mean that! It’s <em>too</em> funny!” and the bed
shook so that Sir Marmaduke almost fell off
the foot-board.</p>

<p>The next moment she turned to Arabella.
“You don’t object to it, do you?” she asked
seriously.</p>

<p>“Well,” Arabella admitted, whispering
very softly so that Sir Marmaduke might not
hear and the Child had to bend low to catch
the words, “to tell the truth, it does get pretty
tiresome. Yes, I rather wish he wasn’t with
me <em>all</em> the time. If you could fix it so that
we could be together just on special occasions,
you know—”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the Child quickly; “I’ll fix it
to-morrow to suit you. I have plenty of
paper left.”</p>

<p>Then she turned to Sir Marmaduke and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
helped him to a seat quite a little away from
Arabella. She thought that relief for the
much afflicted heroine could not come too
soon.</p>

<p>“You don’t talk much, do you?” she observed
to Sir Marmaduke. “I didn’t know
you were such a quiet man.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he answered, twirling his moustache
and settling his cravat after his change
of position, “it’s a case of necessity. You
said I did nothing but listen to the music
of her voice. To be sure, <em>I</em> don’t mind,”
gallantly turning to Arabella, “but I think
she’d like to have me talk more.”</p>

<p>Arabella blushed prettily. “Yes, it would
be more interesting for me,” she agreed.</p>

<p>It was the Child that sighed this time.
“If you’d rather, I’ll change it so you can
talk more. And I’ll make your train shorter,
too,” she said to Arabella. “Five yards is
altogether too much.” She began to wonder
if she could remember all the alterations
that had to be made. There seemed
to be so many things she hadn’t thought
of.</p>

<p>An odd sound coming from Arabella’s side
of the bed arrested her attention. She appeared
to be in some trouble.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked the Child.</p>

<p>“O, I do wish I could yawn!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t,” replied Arabella. “My fan isn’t
here. I forgot to bring it.”</p>

<p>“Do you have to have that before you can
yawn?”</p>

<p>“You said so,” was the answer. “You
said I gave nothing but gentle yawns behind
my fan.”</p>

<p>“O, I’d forgotten,” said the Child. “But
what makes you want to yawn?”</p>

<p>“Because I’m sleepy, you little goosey,”
returned Arabella impatiently. “I guess
you’d be sleepy, too, if you could never have
a wink of sleep from one week’s end to the
other!”</p>

<p>“I guess I would,” the Child confessed.
“But why can’t you sleep when you want to?”</p>

<p>Arabella eyed the Child with astonishment.
“I should think you’d know,” she
said. “You don’t seem to remember that
my hair is spun gold, and how could I ever get
it combed again if I should lie down and get it
all tangled? It would be so much nicer if
it were just hair. Don’t you think you
could—”</p>

<p>“O, yes, of course I can,” the Child answered.
It began to look discouraging.</p>

<p>“And just look at my eyes,” went on
Arabella. “Do you see anything queer about
them?”</p>

<p>The Child looked. “They’re very bright.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” pursued the other, “that’s because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
they’re stars, you see. But I could see much
better out of them if they were just regular
eyes, I think. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course you could,” said the Child.
“Anybody could.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you think so. It will be a relief
to have eyes like other people. If my eyes
were once fixed I shouldn’t care so much
about my ears.”</p>

<p>“Your ears? What is the matter with
them?” demanded the Child.</p>

<p>“You’re queer not to remember,” returned
Arabella. “They’re only pink shells and
they roar so I can’t hear well half the time.
There are other things, too; my mouth, for
instance. You made that a lovely ripe red
cherry, which is, to say the least, inconvenient
and even tempting!”</p>

<p>The Child sighed again. “I wanted to
make you beautiful,” she explained apologetically.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” Arabella replied; “but I
think I’d rather be good than beautiful. It
means more.”</p>

<p>“But you <em>are</em> good, aren’t you?” asked the
Child.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” doubtfully answered Arabella,
“you didn’t pay much attention to that.
I guess I’m too uncomfortable to be good. I
suppose you think that I am not real and it
doesn’t matter, but you see I <em>am</em> real—to you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
You had to think me out. And so <em>I</em> can only
be what <em>you</em> are—that is, what you love and
think and want. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“I see,” the Child reflected.</p>

<p>“And it’s the real that counts,” continued
Arabella. “You can’t always judge from the
outside—either of people or things.”</p>

<p>“No,” put in the Child eagerly, “I know
that. It’s that way with my sums. Sometimes
I will do my figures so carefully and the
example will look lovely when, after all, it’s
full of mistakes.”</p>

<p>“And there’s another thing,” replied Arabella,
“your pride, I mean. As a matter of fact,
you’re writing this story for yourself and not
for Lady-Mother. And, candidly,” she added,
“it’s nothing to be proud of. We’re not much
of a success!”</p>

<p>It was blunt but the Child knew that it
was true. She was silent for a time, then she
said, “It would be a good deal of trouble to
make you all over again and, anyway, I guess
I don’t know enough—yet. You won’t mind
if I don’t?” she inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” Arabella assured her.</p>

<p>The Child was getting sleepy and Arabella
saw it. “Come,” she said to Sir Marmaduke.
“We’re staying too long.” He rose obediently.</p>

<p>“O, must you go?” asked the Child politely.
“Do come again and—that is—of course maybe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
you couldn’t—but still—” her voice grew
fainter and fainter. Arabella and Sir Marmaduke
faded away and presently—</p>

<p>It was the Storyist bending over her. “Good
morning,” she said. “It’s time to get up.”</p>

<p>The Child rubbed her eyes.</p>

<p>And <em>you</em> know, little Dear-My-Love, that
she had been asleep all the while!</p>

<p class="drop-cap">You remember, little
Dear-My-Love, how it
feels just before Christmas.
Well, it was that
kind of a morning. Nearly
everyone carried mysterious
bundles, and
Christmas sights and
sounds were everywhere.</p>

<p>The Child was very
happy. She and the
Storyist were on their way to buy the Gift.
She felt that she needed advice. She had
been surprisingly meek and quiet the last
few days.</p>

<p>“What made you give up your plan?” asked
the Storyist. “Didn’t it suit you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Child. “Besides, the people
in it weren’t happy.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” the Storyist returned.
And then the Child related the Dream.</p>

<p>It was all very interesting and the Storyist
listened attentively.</p>

<p>“So you see,” concluded the Child, “it
wouldn’t do.”</p>

<p>The Storyist thought. “What do you think
a Gift ought to be like?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It ought to be something beautiful all
through, and something good and real and
that would make people glad,” the Child
answered. She had thought it out quite carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>The Storyist promised to do the best she
could.</p>

<p>They spent a good deal of time looking in
the shops and at last made their purchase.
Now it doesn’t matter, little Dear-My-Love,
just what it was; only it was something that
Lady-Mother needed and it was nice and the
Child was satisfied with it.</p>

<p>“But there’s only one Gift,” remarked the
Storyist on their way home, “that is really
everything that you say a Gift ought to be.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked the Child.</p>

<p>The Storyist looked down at her very tenderly.</p>

<p>“Love,” she said.</p>

<p>And after that, little Dear-My-Love, people
often wondered that she was such a thoughtful
Child and tried so hard to make everybody
comfortable. But <em>you</em> know why.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
